        THIRUVANANTHAPURAM
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>The capital city of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum,meaning 
        "The City of Lord Ananta"
     is an appealing blend of a strongly rooted heritage and a nostalgic
     colonial legacy. Built upon seven hills, this city has long since
     left the days when it was only used by seafaring explorers behind 
    - today, Trivandrum is an expensive metropolis with quaint urban 
    charm and plenty of architectural and historical places to visit. 
    In addition, Trivandrum is a gateway to nearby popular beach towns
    of Kovalam and Varkala.
    </p>
    <p>
        The place is well connected to most of the other major cities
        of India through rail, road, and air network. Because of its
        proximity to the sea, the climate of Trivandrum is tropical.
        This also gives Trivandrum a very pleasant weather round the
        year. The average maximum temperature can go up to 35.2 degree 
        celsius in summer months and to a minimum of 18.0 degree celsius
        in the winters. Monsoon comes to Trivandrum in the month of May
        and remains until November.
